# burp-rest-api

## Overview

A REST/JSON API to the [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) security tool.

Since the first commit back in 2016, **burp-rest-api** has been the default tool for BurpSuite-powered web scanning automation. Many security professionals and organizations have relied on this extension to orchestrate the work of Burp Spider and Scanner.

## Getting Started (or "How To Run burp-rest-api")

1) Download the latest *burp-rest-api* JAR (e.g. `burp-rest-api-2.1.0.jar`) and the launcher `burp-rest-api.{sh,bat}` script from the [release page](https://github.com/vmware/burp-rest-api/releases)
2) Place them within a directory having the original Burp Suite Professional JAR (e.g. *burpsuite_pro_v2020.2.1.jar*). Please note that the actual JAR filename doesn't matter since the launcher will include all JARs in the classpath 
3) On Linux and Mac, mark the launcher as executable using `chmod +x burp-rest-api.sh`
4) Bootstrap the system using either `./burp-rest-api.sh` or `./burp-rest-api.bat`, depending on the operating system

### Configuration

By default, Burp is launched in headless mode with the Proxy running on port 8080/tcp (**localhost only**) and the REST endpoint running on 8090/tcp (**localhost only**).

To __run Burp in UI mode__ from the command line, use one of the following commands:

```
    ./burp-rest-api.sh --headless.mode=false
```

On Java <= 1.8, it is also possible to execute burp-rest-api in the following way:

```
    java -jar burp-rest-api-2.1.0.jar --headless.mode=false --burp.jar=./lib/burpsuite_pro.jar
```

To __modify the server port__ on which the API is accessible, use one of the following commands:

```
    ./burp-rest-api.sh --server.port=8081
```
or
```
    ./burp-rest-api.sh --port=8081
```

You can also __modify the server address__, used for network address binding:

```
    ./burp-rest-api.sh --server.address=192.168.1.2
```
or
```
    ./burp-rest-api.sh --address=192.168.1.2
```

### Command Line Arguments

The following command line arguments are used only by the extension to configure the run mode and port number.

`--burp.jar=<filaname.jar>` : Loads the Burp jar dynamically, and expose it through REST APIs. This flag works on Java <= 1.8 only! Use the `burp-rest-api.{sh,bat}` script for newer java versions.

`--burp.ext=<filename.{jar,rb,py}` : Loads the given Burp extensions during application startup. This flag can be repeated.

`--server.port=<port_number>` : The REST API endpoint is available at the given port number. `--port=<port_number>`
 works as short hand argument.
 
 `--server.address=<network address>` : Network address to which the REST API endpoint should bind. `--address=<address_ip>`
  works as short hand argument.

`--headless.mode=<true/false>` : When set to false, runs Burp Suite in UI mode. Otherwise runs Burp Suite in headless
 mode. Default value: System Property (java.awt.headless)

Command line arguments passed to the executable burp-rest-api JAR are forwarded to the Burp Suite JAR. Hence, one may
 pass the following Burp Suite JAR command line arguments to the burp-rest-api JAR for the same functionality as if
 passing to the Burp Suite JAR directly.

`--project-file=<filename>` : Opens the specified **Data Project File** used for keeping the state of the tool. The file will be created as a new project if it doesn't
 exist already.

`--config-file=<filename>` : Opens the project using the options contained in the selected **Project Configuration File**. To load multiple project configurations, this argument can be passed more than once with different values.
 
`--user-config-file=<filename>` : Opens the project using the options contained in the selected **User Configuration File**. To load multiple user configurations, this argument can be passed more than once with different values.

For more information on *Projects*, refer to the Burp Suite documentation
 [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects.html) and [here](https://portswigger.net/blog/introducing-burp-projects).


### Default Burp Configuration ###

If the burp-rest-api JAR is launched without the `--project-file`, `--config-file` or `--user-config-file` arguments, then Burp Suite is
 launched with a temporary project file and some default configuration. The temporary project file gets created upon
 launch of Burp Suite, and gets deleted at the end of the run.

For the default configuration used to launch Burp Suite, please refer to the files _burp-default-project-options.json_ and
_burp-default-user-options.json_ inside the JAR under the _static_ folder.

### HTTP API

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is used to define API documentation. Once the JAR is launched, access the following
 resources for API docs and Swagger UI. Port 8090 is the default server port.

API Docs: http://localhost:8090/v2/api-docs

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html#/

### Client

This project also comes with a client (_BurpClient.java_) written in Java for use in other projects. Refer to the
 Integration Test file _BurpClientIT.java_ for the usage of _BurpClient.java_.

### Extension Development 

The following section contains useful information to get started with the development of the extension.

#### Prerequisites

* Java 8-14 x64
* Gradle
* Licensed Burp Suite Professional version 1.7.x or later from: <http://portswigger.net/burp/>. Considering that Burp Suite Professional 2.x is out of beta, we would recommend to use the latest Burp Suite JAR.

#### Build & Run

1. [Download](https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html) the Professional edition of Burp Suite JAR
2. The project can be run either by executing the Gradle Spring `bootRun` command or by directly launching the JAR
 created from building the project
3. Create a `lib` folder under the project directory and place the Burp Suite JAR file into it and rename it to "burpsuite_pro.jar" in order to run the integration tests

```
    ./gradlew bootRun
```

or

```
    # build the jar
    ./gradlew clean build
    # and run it (Java <= 1.8 only!)
    java -jar build/libs/burp-rest-api-2.1.0.jar --burp.jar=./lib/burpsuite_pro.jar
```

The version number of the JAR should match the version number from `build.gradle` while generating the JAR.

If you want to run the extension on recent (JRE > 9) versions of the JVM, use the `burp-rest-api.{sh,bat}` launcher script after copying *burpsuite_pro.jar* and the *burp-rest-api.jar* in the same directory of the script.

```
# On Unix (Linux, macOS)
./burp-rest-api.sh
# On Windows
./burp-rest-api.bat
```
